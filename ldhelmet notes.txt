add labels to all segments above certain threshold --
run for all 10 chr and the complete genome -- 
scale to same size as clonalframeML xx Bad idea
blow up gff to show where on genome these peaks are, and if they are in or outside of genes. !probably not a good image!

Q's
what to do w/ img problem?
where Gff?
have the peaks, now what
what parameters to change? theta, rho, use pade?, burnin, mut_matrix

run clonal frame with different mu 10-6 - 10-9
ldhelmet infer mut_matrix ask tamara 
ldhelmet run again without belgian sample ask tamara
read into pade coef
plot gff
